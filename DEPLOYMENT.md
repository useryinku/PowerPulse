# PowerPulse Deployment Guide

## ✅ Build Status: Ready for Deployment

Your React application has been successfully configured and tested for deployment on GitHub Pages. All ESLint errors have been resolved and the build compiles successfully.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Your React application is now configured for deployment on GitHub Pages. Here are the deployment options:

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The GitHub Actions workflow is already set up. Every time you push to the `main` or `master` branch, your app will automatically build and deploy.

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to your repository settings
3. Navigate to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. The workflow will automatically run on push to main/master branch

Your app will be available at: `https://useryinku.github.io/PowerPulse`

**Important:** Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled and set to use "GitHub Actions" as the source in your repository settings.

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment or want to deploy immediately:

1. Install gh-pages package:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. Deploy manually:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Important Files for Deployment

- **`client/public/index.html`** - Your main HTML template file
- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- **`client/package.json`** - Contains homepage URL and deployment scripts

## Build Process

The deployment process:
1. Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
2. Builds the React app (`npm run build`)
3. Creates optimized production files in `client/build/`
4. Deploys the `build` folder contents to GitHub Pages

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Deployment Issues

If you encounter "git failed with exit code 128" or similar errors:

1. **Check Repository Settings:**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - Ensure repository is public or you have GitHub Pro

2. **Verify Permissions:**
   - The updated workflow includes proper permissions for Pages deployment
   - The workflow now includes the required `github-pages` environment configuration
   - No additional secrets or tokens needed

3. **Alternative: Manual gh-pages Deployment:**
   If GitHub Actions continues to fail, use the manual method below.

### General Troubleshooting

- Ensure your repository is public or you have GitHub Pro for private repo Pages
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the homepage URL in `package.json` matches your GitHub Pages URL
- Check GitHub Actions tab for build/deployment logs
- If using manual deployment, ensure gh-pages package is installed

## Local Testing

To test the production build locally:
```bash
cd client
npm run build
npx serve -s build
```

This serves the built app locally to verify it works before deployment.
